Encrypting network traffic addresses the threat posed by network eavesdropping. If the risk is deemed sufficiently small you may choose not to encrypt&amp;nbsp;the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of encryption used also affects the types of threats that it addresses. For&amp;nbsp;example, SSL is application-level encryption, whereas IPSec is transport layer encryption. As a result, SSL counters the threat of data tampering or information disclosure from another process on the same machine, particularly one running under a different account in addition to the network eavesdropping threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp;amp; practices guidance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
